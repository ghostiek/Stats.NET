# Stats.NET
A Statistics library written in C#

I'll be adding more distributions down the line, so far the ones I do have will be documented in the Wiki

## TODO
1) Finish testing Simple Linear Model implementation
2) Work on more Samples based on Distributions
3) Work on MultiLinear Models, will need to add ViF, AIC, BIC, AICc, R^2 Adj. 
4) Transformations
5) Find a cleaner way to implement ChiSquared Statistic and Probability
6) Eventually make distributions that allow custom input so people can extrapolate on their sample by assuming a certain distribution
7) Update Wiki

# Stats.NET
A Statistics library written in C#
I'll be adding more distributions down the line, so far the ones I do have will be documented in the Wiki

## TODO
1) Find a way to make MGF/PMFs more than just string, maybe eventually utilize their derivatives to get orders. That would require a library that can either do Indefinite integrals. Odds are I'll just make a GET request to something like WolframAlpha.
2) Find a cleaner way to implement ChiSquared Statistic and Probability
3) Eventually make distributions that allow custom input so people can get extrapolate by assuming a certain distribution
4) Update Wiki

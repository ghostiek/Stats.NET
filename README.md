# Stats.NET
A Statistics library written in C#

I'll be adding more distributions down the line, so far the ones I do have will be documented in the Wiki

## TODO
1) Test extreme cases in Simple Linear Model implementation
2) Fix Normal Sampling, only ranges from -2 to 2. I'll have to go further than x^11
3) Work on more Samples based on Distributions
4) Work on MultiLinear Models, will need to add ViF, AIC, BIC, AICc, R^2 Adj. 
5) Transformations
6) Find a cleaner way to implement ChiSquared Statistic and Probability
7) Eventually make distributions that allow custom input so people can extrapolate on their sample by assuming a certain distribution
8) Update Wiki
